              <p>  He's alive! The Doc's alive! He's in the old west but he's alive! Tell me kid, are you all right? Do you need any help? There's only one man who can help me. (Courthouse Square) (1955 Doc is at the clocktower. He's on it holding the cables. He watches the DeLorean from the first movie, with 1955 Marty inside, approach the clocktower. Doc finishes connecting everything and then slides down the rope.)(into walkie-talkie) Ready to roll! (There is a shot of Clara following them. She can see them now, but they cannot see her.) EMMETT! (into walkie-talkie) Marty, are the time circuits on? (into walkie-talkie)Check, Doc.Lead poisoning. What about the police, Biff? They're gonna match up the bullet with that gun. (He looks down again.) Kid, I own the police! Besides, they couldn't match up the bullet that killed your old man. You son of a bitch! I suppose it's poetic justice - two McFlys with the same gun.(George runs out to the car where Loraine is and jerks the car door open.) Hey you, get your damn hands off…(sees that it's BifF) oh. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. George, help me, please. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.(Marty walks out of the alley and looks around.) The future. (The Courthouse is still there, only now it’s the Courthouse Mall. The clock in the Clock Tower still says 10:04. Marty looks around and sees that the road has a “No Landing” painted on it. There are cars flying all around and Marty can see the skyway from where he stands. Looking up at the Courthouse, he sees that instead of a car park, the central area of the Square now has a nice pond and tropical plants. Marty turns to look behind him and we see that the Texaco station has also changed. It’s now 2 levels. One for hover-converted cars, and one for ground cars.) Welcome to Texaco. You can trust your car with the system with the star. Checking oil, checking landing gear... (Marty looks over and sees that the movie theater is now a Holomax, and Jaws 19 is showing. Marty looks the other way and a holographic shark comes out of the Holomax sign, creeping towards him. It’s just about to ‘eat’ him when Marty turns around and sees it. Marty covers his head and ducks a bit.)

                What's wrong McFly, chicken? (Data plays a chicken sound effect. Marty freezes and turns around to face Griff.) What'd you call me, Griff? Chicken, McFly. (The sound effects of a chicken play again.)(He pulls the letter out.) A letter for me? That's impossible. (He hides the walkie-talkie away.) Who the hell are you? Western Union. Actually a bunch of us guys at the office were kinda hoping maybe you could shed some light on the subject. You see, we've had that envelope in our possession for the past 70 years. (Marty starts opening the letter.) It was given to use with the explicit instructions that it be delivered to a young man with your description...(He gets his umbrella out.) ...answering to the name of Marty, at this exact location, at this exact minute, November 12th 1955. We had a little bet as to whether this Marty would actually be here - looks like I lost! (laughs) Did you say 70 years? Yeah, 70 years, 2 months and 12 days to be exact. Here, sign on line 6 please, here you are.

                (Tannen and his gang approach the festival on horseback.) Buford, you sure that blacksmith is gonna be at this here shindig? Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight. You gentlemen are gonna have to check your firearms if you want to join in on the festivities. (laughs) And who's gonna make us, tender-foot...you?What kind of stupid name is that? I'd say he's the runt of the litter. (goes over to Marty and shows the others Marty's white teeth.) Take a look, see these pearly whites! I ain't seen teeth that straight weren't store bought. Take a look at them moccasins. What kind of skins is them? What's that writing mean...Neekay...what is that, some sort of Injun talk or something? (laughs.) (The Bartender begins to pour them all some whiskey, but the Gang Leader stops him.)(horrified) He's a complete wimp! (Marty Jr. gets up.) So what's it going to be McFly, are you in, or out? Marty Jr.Um, I just, um, I'm not sure that I should, you know, because I think that I should discuss this with my father. Griff/Data/Whitey/Your father?I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Great good, good, Loraine, I had a feeling about you two. I have a feeling too. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Marty, will we ever see you again?(Outside) (George hits Biff in the face. Biff falls down to the floor. George looks at his fist with a "I can't believe it! I did it!" expression and then turns to Lorraine.) Yes! (o.s) There's a fight over here, come on guys! Talk about deja vu.

                (aside to Marty) The only problem is we'll never be able to show it to anybody. Smile, Doc. (There is a big flash and Marty and Doc stand there like they're blind.) (The Festival) (An old time band is playing.)Hello, Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. (Hallway) Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.(Biff’s Car) (w.t) Doc! (The car enters the tunnel, meaning the radio and the walkie-talkies are cut off temporally.) (Courthouse Square) (w.t) Marty? (normally) Oh my...(We see what Doc has spotted. It's the DeLorean from Part 1 under the covers! Doc goes over to it.) Great Scott! (He lifts up the covers and peers in.) Oh my God.Whoa!! Emmett! Clara! Hold on! I can't! (She screams in desperation as her dress begins to rip.) (Inside the Delorean, the hoverboard flies by itself into a seat beside Marty.)Wow, you must be rich. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

                McFly! (Jennifer jumps at this. Marty turns around to see his boss.) Oh! Fujitsu-san! Konnichi wa! McFly! I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced. You are terminated! Terminated! No, no! It wasn't my fault sir, it was Needles, Needles was behind the whole thing!(Marty runs over to a kid who's on a scooter.) Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey. I'll get it back to you, alright? (Marty breaks off the top part of the scooter, leaving a 1955 version of a skateboard. He takes off on it.)No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Well, she's not doing a very good job. (They go to kiss but a woman shoves a flyer in their faces.) Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.(w.t) Doc! (DeLorean) (v.o) Doc, come in! (w.t) Marty, come in! (School – The Dance)

                Great Scott! (He faints.) Doc. C'mon. (Doc's House) (Marty drives Doc home in the rain following the lightening strike. He hangs up the letter from the Doc in 1885 by the fireplace to dry.)Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. (The Dance) (Marty is up on stage with the Band playing the guitar. They're playing 'Earth Angel'.) This is for all you lovers out there. George, aren't you gonna kiss me?4 cans for a $300 job? I can't even have lunch… I should be getting a case or more out of you for a 300 buck job. (They keep arguing as Biff throws the cans in the back of the car, where they land on Marty.) It's the last time I ever do you a favor! Last time!George. (to kid) Excuse me. (he shoves the kid out of the way and kisses Loraine.) (Marty comes back and both his brother and sister show up in the picture again.) Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Uh, well, I gotta go.You want to sober him up in a hurry, son, you're gonna have to use something a lot stronger than coffee. Yeah, what do you suggest? (smiles) Joey. Let's make some wake up juice. (They pull out several ingredients. The Bartender pours a little of everything into a glass.) In about ten minutes, he's gonna be as sober as a priest on Sunday.
